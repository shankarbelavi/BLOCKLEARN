# BlockLearn - Decentralized Skill Exchange Platform

A decentralized peer-to-peer skill exchange platform combining web3 and real-time communication.
BlockLearn is a innovative platform that connects learners with mentors for skill exchanges using blockchain technology for verification and reputation management. The platform features real-time video calling, chat functionality, and a smart matching algorithm to connect users with complementary skills.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Email OTP and Google OAuth
- **Skill Matching**: Algorithmic matching of users for skill exchange
- **Real-time Communication**: Chat and WebRTC video calling
- **Blockchain Integration**: Skill completion tracking and reputation management
- **Feedback System**: Post-session ratings and reviews
- **Admin Panel**: User management and moderation tools
- **Mentor-Admin Video Calling**: Secure video conferencing between mentors and administrators

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- React 18 with Vite
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Socket.IO client for real-time communication
- WebRTC for video calling
- React Router for navigation

### Backend
- Node.js with Express
- MongoDB for database
- Socket.IO for real-time communication
- WebRTC with PeerJS for video calling
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication

### Blockchain
- Solidity smart contracts
- Hardhat for deployment and testing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
